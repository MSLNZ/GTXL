Installing for the first time
=============================

Install software
----------------

First run ``setup.exe`` to copy the GUM Tree Excel Calculator files to your computer. This will also install the COM server. 

.. note::

    Administrator rights are required.
    
Load the add-in
---------------
 
Next, the Excel add-in can be loaded as follows:

    * Open Excel 
    * Navigate to the ``Add-Ins`` dialog in the ``Options`` menu and click ``Go ...`` to access the ``Manage Add-Ins`` dialog. 
    * Click ``Browse ...`` and then navigate to the ``addin`` folder of the ``GTXL`` installation, typically :: 
    
        C:\Program Files (x86)\GTXL\addin
        
    * Select ``gtxl.xlam`` and load the add-in. A dialog box should appear, indicating that the add-in has been successfully loaded.

.. _upgrade:

Upgrading 
=========

Run the new ``setup.exe`` installer to upgrade ``GTXL``. 

You will be prompted to replace any previous version.

.. note::

    Excel add-in settings are not affected by an upgrade. The new ``GTXL`` version should be installed in the same directory as the previous version. 

    
.. _uninstall:

Uninstalling
============

Unload the Excel add-in first, as follows

    * Open Excel 
    * Navigate to the ``Add-Ins`` dialog in the Excel ``Options`` menu and then push ``Go ...`` to access the ``Manage Add-Ins`` dialog. 
    * An item called `GTXL Uncertainty Tool` will appear with a tick mark in this dialog. Simply un-tick the entry, then close the dialog and Excel. 

Then remove the software

The *Add / Remove Programs* utility of the *Windows Control Panel* can be used to remove the software. Alternatively, there is a link to the ``uninstall.exe`` program  the ``GTXL`` Windows *Start* menu folder. 

.. note::

    Administrator rights are required.

    Not all files are removed by this process, but any remaining files and folders can be deleted manually later, if necessary.

Documentation
=============

Several forms of documentation are provided. They can be accessed from shortcuts in the ``GTXL`` group in the Windows *Start* menu. 
    
Examples
========

A folder containing examples is located by a shortcut in the ``GTXL`` group of the Windows *Start* menu.

.. note::

    Usually the ``Examples`` folder is located under ``C:\Program Files (x86)``, where Administrator privileges are needed to modify files. It may be convenient to make a copy of the ``Examples`` folder in another location on the computer where file access is not restricted.
