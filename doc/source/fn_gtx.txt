GTX()
-----

.. function:: GTX(expr [,arg1,...])

    Evaluate ``expr``
    
    :arg expr: a string containing an expression or equation
    :arg arg1: an expression parameter
    
    The ``expr`` string may be in the form of an equation, e.g.::
    
        x = 1
        
    or an expression, e.g.::
    
        value(x)
        
    When ``expr`` is an equation, the token on the left-hand side 
    of ``=`` will be associated with the value of the expression 
    on the right-hand side. After execution, the token will appear in 
    the cell.
    
    When ``expr`` is an expression, it must evaluate to a number or
    string and that result will appear in the cell. 
    
    .. note::
    
        A ``#VALUE`` will appear in the cell if the value of the 
        expression is not a type that Excel recognises.
