The `gtxl_setup.exe` file will install GTXL on your system.

If you are installing GTXL for the first time, you will need to open Excel and activate the GTXL addin, after running the setup program. See the documentation for more detailed instructions on how to do this. 

The installation process copies files under 'C:\Program Files (x86)\GTXL' and in particular the new addin is located under 'C:\Program Files (x86)\GTXL\addin'.

A GTXL folder will be added to the Windows Start menu. This gives access to the help files and to an uninstall program (The Windows Control Panel can also be used now too).
